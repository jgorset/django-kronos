Kronos
======

.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/jgorset/django-kronos.png?branch=master

Kronos makes it really easy to schedule tasks with cron.

Installation
------------

::

    $ pip install django-kronos

... and add ``kronos`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

Usage
-----

Define tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Kronos collects tasks from ``cron`` modules in your project root and each of your applications::

    # app/cron.py

    import kronos
    import random

    @kronos.register('0 0 * * *')
    def complain():
        complaints = [
            "I forgot to migrate our applications's cron jobs to our new server! Darn!",
            "I'm out of complaints! Damnit!"
        ]

        print random.choice(complaints)

If you have a task in a Django Command you can register it doing::

    # app/management/commands/task.py

    from django.core.management.base import NoArgsCommand

    import kronos

    @kronos.register('0 0 * * *')
    class Command(NoArgsCommand):
        def handle_noargs(self, **options):
            print('command task')



Run tasks manually
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    $ python manage.py runtask complain
    I forgot to migrate our applications's cron jobs to our new server! Darn!

Keep in mind that if the registered task is a django command you have to run it
in the normal way::

    $ python manage.py task


List all registered tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    $ python manage.py showtasks
    * List of tasks registered in Kronos *
    >> Kronos tasks
        >> my_task_one
        >> my_task_two
    >> Django tasks
        >> my_django_task


Register tasks with cron
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    $ python manage.py installtasks
    Installed 1 task.

You can review the crontab with a ``crontab -l`` command::

    $ crontab -l
    0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python /path/to/manage.py runtask complain --settings=myprpoject.settings $KRONOS_BREAD_CRUMB
    0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python /path/to/manage.py task --settings=myprpoject.settings $KRONOS_BREAD_CRUMB

Usually this line will work pretty well for you, but there can be some rare
cases when it requires modification. You can achieve it with a number of
settings variables used by kronos:

KRONOS_PYTHON
    Python interpreter to build a crontab line (defaults to the interpreter you used to
    invoke the management command).

KRONOS_MANAGE
    Management command to build a crontab line (defaults to ``manage.py`` in the current
    working directory).

KRONOS_PYTHONPATH
    Extra path which will be added as a ``--pythonpath`` option to the management command.

KRONOS_POSTFIX
    Extra string added at the end of the command. For dirty thinks like '> /dev/null 2>&1'

Define these variables in your ``settings.py`` file if you wish to alter crontab lines.

The env variable ``$KRONOS_BREAD_CRUMB`` is defined to detect which tasks have to be deleted after
being installed.
